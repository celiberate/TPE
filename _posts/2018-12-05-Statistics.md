Random Distribution vs Gaussian Distribution
Normal Curve - Probabilistic Distribution

Z-Score : Z-Score is just another measure of average score. A z-score of 1 means we are 1 standard deviation away from average. Z-Score of Mean is always equal to 0.

ANOVA
Null Hypothesis / Alternate Hypothesis
T-Test





We have to find solution for AX = b where X is the vector of unknowns.
$$
AX = b
X = (A^TA)^-1A^Tb
$$

ATA has an inverse only if columns of A re independent i.e. AX = 0 has only 1 solution and that is zero vector.

If AX = 0 has more than one solution, that means columns are dependent and hence that mean ATA is not invertible.

so for linear regression to work, A should have independent columns (features)
