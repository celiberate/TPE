title: Learning ML - Prerequisites
---
Standard deviation, eigenValues, patial derivatives...When was the last time you encountered these words. For someone like me whose previous encounter with these Mathematics and Statistics topics, were more than a decade back, even getting started with learning ML first required lot of groundwork and cleaning up the dust settled on those high school maths and statistics concepts.

Unlike learning a new language or a framework, where we take a clean slate and start with writing a "Hello World" program or steps to build, in the case of ML, I was not even sure where & how to begin with. Because ML will require you to have a good understanding of

1. Linear Algebra
2. Calculus
3. Probability
4. Statistics
5. Algorithms & Data Structures
6. Programming Languages - Python (or R)
7. Numerous Python packages - Numpy, Pandas, Matplotlib...etc
8. Big Data
9. ....
10. & many more

so my pre-requisite for beginners for learning ML is fairly simple
- **Come out of Comfort Zone**
- **Be physical fit** (it will require a lot of mental strength)

Rest all skills you can acquire over the journey as you deep dive in this mammoth world of Machine Learning. One thing is for sure, no matter whether machine learns or not, you will enjoy getting back to school days and revisiting fundamental topics of vectors, matrices, permutations, mean, medians...
